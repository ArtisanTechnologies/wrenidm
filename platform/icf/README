This is an updated version 1.0.5754 of ICF LDAP connector.
Two issues should be fixed here:
* Delete synchronization event with entryUUID attribute as __UID__
* Filtering out based on changeInitiatorsName in changelog in addition
  to modifiersName (which does not work for new and deleted entries)

The version has a "openidm" suffix to it so it will not get confised with
the original version.

To use this in OpenIDM now, two changes are needed (before build):

Import the connector to the local maven repository:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=org.identityconnectors.ldap-1.0.5754openidm.jar -DpomFile=org.identityconnectors.ldap-1.0.5754openidm.pom -DcreateChecksum=true

Modify the POM file in OpenIDM-identityconnector-integration by adding the
following:

                                <artifactItem>
                                    <groupId>org.identityconnectors</groupId>
                                    <artifactId>org.identityconnectors.ldap</artifactId>
                                    <version>1.0.5754openidm</version>
                                    <type>jar</type>
                                    <overWrite>true</overWrite>
                                    <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/classes/META-INF/bundles</outputDirectory>
                                </artifactItem>

Updated resource file that takes use of this version is in
samples/opendj-localhost-resource-sync-5754openidm.xml
