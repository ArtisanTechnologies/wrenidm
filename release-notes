Known Issues
============

An error is encoutered on the very first attempt to login. Reload the page
to be able to log in.
This is most likely caused by ICEFaces, we are working on it. The error is:
com.sun.faces.application.view.StateHolderSaver cannot be cast to
[Ljava.lang.Object; exception but It's ICEFaces exception

Many error messages are not yet propagated to the GUI. To see the reason of a
failure please see the error log.

Session timeouts are not handled well. This also seems to be a problem with
ICEFaces.

Default XML namespace occasionally does not work during import and in web
service calls. The problem seems to be in OpenESBv2 message normalization
routine. The workaround is to qualify all XML elements with a namespace prefix
and also remove the default namespace declaration (xmlns="...").

Running the application using JDK 6 update 17 can cause problems with saxon: instead of it the default xerces implementation is used and can cause errors in XPathExpression evaluation (reproduced on Linux). Using the latest JDK solves the problem.
